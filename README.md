Problem:
I supposed to create a method that iterates through a list of Strings and prints out
any duplicate entries.

Solution:
I created a method that accepts List<String> for and argument. once I call the method
with the required argument it loads the said list with some pre-added Strings. and then
loops through the list and adds the string entry to a hashset list returns false if the
entry has already been added to the list then it will print the said string because a
hashset will not add an entry that has been added once already.

Problem:
I need to create an method that checks to see if a String is a palindrome or not and
print out its result.

Solution:
Create a method that takes a String as an argument and loops through the said String in
reverse adding each character to a local String variable. Once the loops complete if then
call a conditional statement comparing both String variable to each other and if they
are equal return true and print that they are an Palindrome String. and if not return false
printing out that they are not an Palindrome String.


3.
Problem:
create an method that will check to see if an number is divisible by 5 & 3, if so then print
"FizzBuzz". if not check to see if its divisible by 5 and if so print Fizz. If not check
to see if the number is divisble by 3 and if so print 3. if not just print out the entered
number.

Solution:
I created a method that takes a int as an argument and then takes that said number and goes
through series of conditional statements divising itself by my previously stated operations
and if any matches print out either FizzBuzz, Fizz, or Buzz. and if the number is not
divisible by any of the configured operations then just print the number itself.
